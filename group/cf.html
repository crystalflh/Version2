	Slave humanity was denied . They was owned by other peoples who had power over them . Slaves was like a pieces of  a property because they were sold for crops . Also they would sell slaves to get more and stronger slaves . They had start trade because Europeans empires resource . Therefore they didn't wanted to pay for workers so they decided to have slaves to work for them . There were more Africans that arrived in the Americas than Europeans. That's when they shipped slaves of the caribbean , and the spanish empire because they needed slaves on their plantations . Most slave where own by American .
