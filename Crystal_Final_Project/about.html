<p>My name is Crystal and I am a 19 years old. Being a very ambitious person, I follow what is on my mind and let nothing get in my way. Many people tell me my personality is unique because I constantly elaborate and think deeply on my work. I am a tenacious person because when I want something done I get it done without any hesitation . When I graduate from high school I want to go to a Spelman college. The reason why I want to go to Spelman colleges is to study law . I want to study law because Since I was young, I would always watch Law and Order and Criminal Minds as well as the news. From watching those shows, I was inspired to learn more about the justice system.
